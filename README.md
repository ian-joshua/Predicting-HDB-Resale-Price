# Predicting-HDB-Resale-Price

## Background
For individuals exploring resale houses, important considerations such as the storey of the house, location, and property size are crucial. Understanding how these factors affect resale prices and having an estimated price enables informed decision-making when purchasing resale houses. Given the substantial investment that real estate represents for individuals, these understandings are crucial for securing properties aligned with their preferences and financial objectives.
Therefore, is it possible to predict the resale price of a flat based on the prospective owner's preferences (such as location, storey range, floor square area, etc.), enabling them to make informed decisions about their expected expenditure?

## Objectives
This study aims to predict resale prices, providing valuable insights for individuals and enabling informed choices.
